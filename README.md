## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **Spotify's Top 50 playlists** from various countries worldwide, as well as the global Top 50 playlist, retrieved using the **Spotify API**. To complement missing artist genre data, the project integrates the **Discogs API**, enriching the analysis with a more comprehensive understanding of musical styles. Additionally, **web scraping** techniques are utilized to group genres into broader categories, enhancing the clarity and depth of the analysis.

The application offers a user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**, allowing users to visualize music trends interactively. By leveraging a combination of API integrations, web scraping, and interactive dashboards, this project provides valuable insights into how music preferences vary across regions and within a global context.

## Setup and Installation

_This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. Follow these steps to run the project:_

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Viktoriia-Shalaieva/Spotify-Data-Analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Spotify-Data-Analysis
   ```   
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Optional**: Create a `.credentials.yaml` file in the main directory with the following structure:
   ```yaml
   aws:
     aws_access_key_id: YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
     aws_secret_access_key: YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

   spotify:
     client_id: YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
     client_secret: YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET

   discogs:
     discogs_api_token: YOUR_DISCOGS_API_TOKEN
   ```

   - Replace `YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` with your AWS credentials.
   - Replace `YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` with your Spotify API credentials. You can obtain these by creating an app on the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
   - Replace `YOUR_DISCOGS_API_TOKEN` with your Discogs API token, available from your [Discogs developer account](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers).

   > **Note**: This step is required only if you intend to run the `download_preprocess_data.py` script to update the data.

5. **Optional for updating data**: Run the data preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python download_preprocess_data.py
   ```
   > **Note**: As of [November 27, 2024](https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2024-11-27-changes-to-the-web-api), Spotify has deprecated access to playlist API endpoints. If you don't have access to the Spotify API, you can skip this step and use the local data provided in the `data/` folder.

6. Launch the Streamlit dashboard:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
